	<h1>Who was A. von H. ?</h1>
	<img src="/images/Alexander Humboldt.jpeg" alt="Alexander">
    <p>Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (* 14 September 1769 in Berlin; â€  6 May 1859 Ebenda.) was a German explorer <br>
       whose sphere of influence extended far beyond Europe.
       In his complete works, written over a period of more than seven decades, <br>
       he created "a new state of knowledge and reflection of the knowledge of the world" 
       and became the co-founder of geography <br>
       as an empirical science.</p>
